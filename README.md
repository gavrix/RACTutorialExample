RACTutorialExample
==================

This project is a very simple example on how to use ReactiveCocoa, used in [this tutorial](http://www.binpress.com/tutorial/reactivecocoa/20). It makes ani API request to api.github.com/users and represents table with first page of the response. Images associated with the users are downloaded asynchronously.
